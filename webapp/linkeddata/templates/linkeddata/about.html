    <h2>What is RAFCO Ontology?</h2>
    <div class="indent">
        <p>The <i>Recipes, Allergies and Food Composition Ontology</i> (RAFCO) project comprises
        an <b>ontology</b> and a <b>Linked Data application</b> 
        targeted at the representation and exploration of knowledge about <b>food</b>, <b>recipes</b> and their
        relation with different food <b>allergies</b>. </p>
        
        <p>The   main   goal   of   RAFCO   is   to   give   new   possibilities   to   the   potential   users   in  
finding   recipes,   taking   into   account   any   problem   related   with   a   specific   disease   as  
well as being able to perform an advanced search according to different criteria.</p>
<p>Nowadays,   it   is   not   easy   to   find   an   <b>automated   solution</b>   to   these   issues,   
and   that   is   one   of   the   main   accomplishments   of RAFCO. </p>

<p>This project was developed during the <b>Ontology Engineering</b> course from the <b>Msc. in Artificial Intelligence</b> at
the Technical University of Madrid. Different resources are available with more information about RAFCO: </p>
